# Income Project

## Problem setting
A polling institute wants to be able to estimate an individual's income from his/her personal
data (see einkommen.train). To this aim, 30.000 individuals were interviewed concerning
the features summarized below. For some of the individuals, not all features are
available. Crucially, the income of only 5.000 of the interviewee's is known.
Your task is to predict the income group of the remaining 25.000 interviewees and to
prepare the data such that they can be used for further regression and correlation analyses. <Br/>
